# hello-world

Hello, I'm Jamal!

I am a former chemical engineering student. I found myself not enjoying the work I was doing and the problems I was solving in my major, and now I'm testing the waters of computer science to see how they feel. I recently enrolled in CS50x, and am likely going to attempt to self-teach and become a developer. I am thoroughly enjoying the thought process and mindset of computer science, and I'm looking forward to being able to tackle new challenges every day!
